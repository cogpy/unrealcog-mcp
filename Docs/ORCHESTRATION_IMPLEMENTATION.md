# OpenCog Multi-Agent Orchestration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an OpenCog-inspired multi-agent orchestration workbench for the Unreal Engine MCP integration. This system enables multiple AI assistant clients (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop) to work collaboratively on Unreal Engine projects through coordinated workflows, knowledge sharing, and task delegation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Management System**
   - Session registration and tracking
   - Capability-based agent profiles
   - Activity monitoring and status management

2. **Knowledge AtomSpace**
   - OpenCog-inspired hypergraph knowledge base
   - Typed knowledge atoms (blueprints, actors, workflows, best practices)
   - Source attribution and access tracking
   - Thread-safe concurrent access

3. **Workflow Coordination**
   - Priority-based task queue
   - Task claiming and assignment
   - Status tracking (pending, claimed, completed, failed)
   - Workflow history for audit trails

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Registration
```python
register_agent("cursor-main", "cursor", "blueprint_creation,level_design")
```

### Knowledge Sharing
```python
share_knowledge(
    "blueprint",
    '{"name": "BP_Player", "status": "completed"}',
    "cursor-main"
)
```

### Task Coordination
```python
create_workflow_task(
    "create_actor",
    '{"name": "TestCube", "type": "StaticMeshActor"}',
    "",
    5
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Multi-Client Collaboration**: Multiple AI assistants can work together seamlessly
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Avoid duplicate work through shared atomspace
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Coordinated workflows prevent concurrent modification issues
4. **Capability Matching**: Tasks assigned based on agent capabilities
5. **Priority Management**: Important tasks get processed first
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete workflow history for tracking and debugging
7. **Scalability**: Thread-safe design supports concurrent operations
